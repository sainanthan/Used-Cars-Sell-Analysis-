# 🚗 Used Car Sales Analysis Dashboard

# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a Used Car Sales Dataset to uncover insights about car brands, fuel types, transmission, ownership, accident history, and pricing trends.
The project is completed in 4 phases:

1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python / Pandas)

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3.Insights & Comparisons

4.Interactive Power BI Dashboard

5.The final output is a multi-page Power BI dashboard that provides deep insights into the used car market.

# 📂 Dataset

->Source: Provided CSV dataset (Used Car Sales).

->Rows: ~140k

->Columns: Brand, Model, Variant, Car Type, Transmission, Fuel Type, Year, Kilometers, Owner, State, Accidental, Price.

# ⚙️ Phase 1: Data Cleaning

1.Checked for null values → No missing data.

2.Detected & handled outliers (Price had 1820 outliers).

3.Cleaned data for consistency (e.g., Fuel Type, Transmission categories).

# 🔎 Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1.Top Car Brand → Maruti Suzuki (54,030 cars).

2.Most Common Car Type → Hatchback (55,890 cars).

3.Fuel Type Majority → Petrol (79,187 cars).

4.Most Common Transmission → Manual (119,793 cars).

5.Kilometer Stats: Avg ~95,000 km.

6.Outliers detected mainly in Price, not in Kilometers.

# 📊 Phase 3: Insights & Comparisons

1.Automatic cars are ~9.8% more expensive than Manual (for Petrol cars).

2.Hybrid & Electric cars have highest average prices.

3.First-owner cars have higher resale value compared to multiple-owner cars.

4.Accidental cars are fewer and tend to have lower prices.

# 📈 Phase 4: Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard has 3 pages:

# 📄 Page 1: Brand & Car Type Analysis

->Top 5 Car Brands by sales.

->Distribution of Car Types (Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, etc.).

# 📄 Page 2: Transmission & Fuel Insights

->Transmission split (Manual vs Automatic).

->Fuel type distribution.

->Avg Price by Fuel & Transmission.

# 📄 Page 3: Price Distribution

->Avg Price by Car Type.

->Top 10 Most Expensive Brands.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

1.Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → Data cleaning & EDA.

2.Power BI → Dashboard creation & visualization.

3.GitHub → Version control & project showcase.


# 📢 Key Learnings

1.Handling large datasets (~140k rows).

2.Performing EDA with outlier detection.

3.Building interactive dashboards in Power BI.

4.Writing data-driven business insights.
